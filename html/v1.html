    <p>Donald Trump developed a admiration for the communication he famously took to Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign. His staff members were able to give large amounts of information. Trump once wrote on twitter,  "and can explain something to me with a minimum of words." and also added "Sometimes ten words or less,". Security officials are very frustrated about this. The top secret meetings were held and Trump, he is giving too much information on the media. Those familiar with the sessions say they are important opportunities for both the briefer and the recipients of the information to develop a relationship and create the feeling of a continuing conversation.</p>

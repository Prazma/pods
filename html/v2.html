    <p><strong>The color "white" you see on TV. Its no ordinary white.</strong></p>

    <p>Your color TV uses one of the greatest optical illusions of all. It makes red, green, and blue dots appear to be white. Look up really close at TV or computer screen that is displaying the color white and all you’ll see are red, green, and blue dots, no white ones. (You may need a magnifying glass to see the tiny individual dots.) But if you sit back, they blur together and make white. [In a comment, Tim Volkov made an excellent suggestion: No magnifying glass needed - just a drop of water on the screen! That acts an an excellent high power magnifying glass.] Your eye has three color sensors: one each for red, green, and blue (RGB). True white light from the sun contains all the colors of the rainbow, not just RGB. True white makes all three RGB sensors respond. Here’s the trick: when the screen wants to deceive your eye into thinking the color is white, it lights up all three colors. That excites all three RGB sensors in your eye, in exactly the same way they would be excited by true white sunlight. Since that is all your brain knows – that all three have detected light – it interprets it as white light. Your brain is fooled. Some people are reputed to have four sensors, not three, so they would not be fooled by false TV white. What would it look like to them? We don’t have the words to describe the colors they see, because so few of us have that ability. They probably would call us “colorblind” for getting TV White confused with True White.</p>
